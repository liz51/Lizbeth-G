				<li> first you take a pink nail polish and do a cape of that nail polish wait for it to dry. (I would recomend to buy
					a light pink color)</li>
				<li> Once it's dried you get a pink nail polish with glitter and do a cape. (It's your'e option if you want to put glitter
					on)</li>
				<li>Then you get a black color polish and a thin brush (the thiniest brush you could get.) You make lines from the out
					side from the nail and then bring it in the middle (don't go to the other side of the nail!) make three lines on one
					side and three on the other side (try not to make them that close and DO NOT let it drie!)</li>
				<li>Once that is done then paint over the lines that you already made do the same with the other lines.</li>
				<li>Finish it with a top coat and DONE!!</li>

					<li> First you get a light nail polish color and put a base on(it is your're decision if you want to put one coat on,
						it depends on how thick you want the base coat to be.) </li>
					<li> Once it is dried you need to get a small sponge and three more colors you might want to chose from a light color
						to a darker color (but don't get a lighter color than you're base coat color,I would recomend a triangle shape but
						small!)</li>
					<li> Then put you're colors in the sponge from the lightest color to the darkest color (put the darkest color on the
						bottom,the medium color in the middle and the lightest color at the top but don't go all the way to the top because
						you are going to need the top!)</li>
					<li>Then kind of stamp the sponge thru the nail and then grab the top and kind of just soften it do the same process
						to the other nails (it is you're decision what amount of color do you want to put!)</li>
					<li> Finish it of with a coat of glitter or just a clear nail polish and DONE!</li>
